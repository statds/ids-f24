## Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' 
Theorem, which is used for both binary and multiclass classification 
problems. It is particularly effective for high-dimensional datasets 
and is commonly applied in tasks like text classification, spam 
detection, and sentiment analysis. The algorithm is called "naive" 
because it assumes that all features are conditionally independent 
given the class label, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world 
data but still performs well in many cases.

### Theoretical Foundations

The foundation of the Naive Bayes classifier is Bayes' Theorem, which 
is used to update the probability estimate of a hypothesis given new 
evidence. Mathematically, Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

$$
P(y \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid y) \, P(y)}{P(X)},
$$

where:

- $P(y \mid X)$: Posterior probability of class $y$ given the input 
  features $X$.
- $P(X \mid y)$: Likelihood of observing $X$ given that the class is 
  $y$.
- $P(y)$: Prior probability of the class $y$.
- $P(X)$: Marginal probability of the feature vector $X$.


#### Naive Assumption and Likelihood Decomposition

The algorithm makes the simplifying assumption that features in $X$ 
are conditionally independent given the class $y$. This assumption 
enables the likelihood $P(X \mid y)$ to be decomposed as:

$$
P(X \mid y) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i \mid y),
$$

where $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ represents the feature vector 
with $n$ features, and $P(x_i \mid y)$ is the conditional probability 
of feature $x_i$ given the class $y$.



The model parameters are the prior probabilities $P(y)$ and the 
conditional probabilities $P(x_i \mid y)$. These are estimated from 
the training data using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE):

1. Prior Estimation:
   The prior probability $P(y)$ is estimated as the proportion of 
   training samples in class $y$:

   $$
   \hat{P}(y) = \frac{\text{count}(y)}{N},
   $$
   
   where $\text{count}(y)$ is the number of instances belonging to 
   class $y$, and $N$ is the total number of training samples.

2. Conditional Probability Estimation:
   - Categorical Features: For discrete or categorical features, 
     the conditional probability $P(x_i \mid y)$ is estimated as:

     $$
     \hat{P}(x_i \mid y) = \frac{\text{count}(x_i, y)}{\text{count}(y)},
     $$

     where $\text{count}(x_i, y)$ is the number of samples in class $y$ 
     that have feature $x_i$.
   
   - Continuous Features: For continuous features, Naive Bayes 
     commonly assumes a Gaussian distribution. In this case, 
	 $P(x_i \mid y)$ is modeled using the Gaussian distribution with mean 
     $\mu_{y,i}$ and variance $\sigma_{y,i}^2$:

     $$
     P(x_i \mid y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{y,i}^2}} \exp \left( 
     -\frac{(x_i - \mu_{y,i})^2}{2\sigma_{y,i}^2} \right).
     $$

     The parameters $\mu_{y,i}$ and $\sigma_{y,i}^2$ are estimated 
     from the training data using the sample mean and variance for 
     each feature in each class.

#### Class Prediction

The goal of the Naive Bayes classifier is to predict the class $y$ that 
maximizes the posterior probability $P(y \mid X)$. After applying 
Bayes' Theorem and dropping the constant denominator $P(X)$, the 
decision rule becomes:

$$
y^* = \arg\max_y \, P(y) \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i \mid y).
$$

In practice, the log of the posterior is used to prevent numerical 
underflow:

$$
\log P(y \mid X) = \log P(y) + \sum_{i=1}^n \log P(x_i \mid y).
$$

The predicted class is the one that maximizes this expression.

#### Surprisingly Good Performance

Although the assumption of conditional independence among features is 
often unrealistic, Naive Bayes still performs well for several reasons:

1. Robustness to Violations of Independence: Literature suggests 
   that Naive Bayes can achieve good classification performance even 
   when features are correlated, as long as the dependencies are 
   consistent across classes [@domingos1997optimality]. This is 
   because the decision boundaries produced by Naive Bayes are often 
   well-aligned with the true boundaries, despite the imprecise 
   probability estimates.

2. Decision Rule Effectiveness: Since Naive Bayes focuses on 
   finding the class that maximizes the posterior probability, it is 
   less sensitive to errors in individual probability estimates, as 
   long as the relative ordering of probabilities remains correct 
   [@rish2001empirical].

3. Zero-One Loss Minimization: Naive Bayes aims to minimize the 
   zero-one loss, i.e., the number of misclassifications. The method 
   benefits from the fact that exact probability estimation is not 
   essential for accurate classification, as the correct class can 
   still be chosen even with approximate probabilities 
   [@ng2001discriminative].

4. High-Dimensional Settings: In high-dimensional settings, the 
   conditional independence assumption can act as a form of implicit 
   regularization, preventing overfitting by simplifying the 
   probability model [@rish2001empirical]. This makes Naive Bayes 
   particularly well-suited for text classification and other sparse 
   feature spaces.

#### Advantages and Limitations

Advantages:

- Computationally efficient, with linear time complexity in terms of 
  the number of features and data samples.
- Performs well on large datasets, especially when features are 
  conditionally independent.
- Suitable for high-dimensional data, making it popular in text 
  classification.

Limitations:

- Relies on the assumption of conditional independence, which may not 
  hold in real-world datasets, potentially affecting performance.
- It is sensitive to zero probabilities; if a feature value never 
  appears in the training set for a given class, its likelihood becomes 
  zero. To address this, Laplace smoothing (or add-one smoothing) 
  is often applied.

#### Laplace Smoothing

Laplace smoothing is used to handle zero probabilities in the 
likelihood estimation. It adds a small constant $ \alpha $ (usually 1) 
to the count of each feature value, preventing the probability from 
becoming zero:

$$
P(x_i \mid y) = \frac{\text{count}(x_i, y) + \alpha}
{\sum_{x_i'} (\text{count}(x_i', y) + \alpha)}.
$$

This adjustment ensures that even unseen features in the training data 
do not lead to zero probabilities, thus improving the model’s robustness.
