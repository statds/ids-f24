# Data Manipulation

## Introduction

Data manipulation is crucial for transforming raw data into a
more analyzable format, essential for uncovering patterns and
ensuring accurate analysis. This chapter introduces the core
techniques for data manipulation in Python, utilizing the Pandas
library, a cornerstone for data handling within Python's data
science toolkit.


Python's ecosystem is rich with libraries that facilitate not
just data manipulation but comprehensive data analysis. Pandas,
in particular, provides extensive functionality for data
manipulation tasks including reading, cleaning, transforming,
and summarizing data. Using real-world datasets, we will explore
how to leverage Python for practical data manipulation tasks.


By the end of this chapter, you will learn to:

- Import/export data from/to diverse sources.
- Clean and preprocess data efficiently.
- Transform and aggregate data to derive insights.
- Merge and concatenate datasets from various origins.
- Analyze real-world datasets using these techniques.

## NYC Crash Data

Consider a subset of the NYC Crash Data, which contains all
NYC motor vehicle collisions data with documentation from
[NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95).
We downloaded the crash data for the week of June 30, 2024,
on September 16, 2024, in CSC format.
```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'data/nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20240916.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Replace column names: convert to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure
df.head()
```

Now we can do some cleaning after a quick browse.
```{python}
# Replace invalid coordinates (latitude=0, longitude=0 or NaN) with NaN
df.loc[(df['latitude'] == 0) & (df['longitude'] == 0), 
       ['latitude', 'longitude']] = pd.NA
df['latitude'] = df['latitude'].replace(0, pd.NA)
df['longitude'] = df['longitude'].replace(0, pd.NA)

# Longitude/latitude don't need double precision
df['latitude'] = df['latitude'].astype('float32', errors='ignore')
df['longitude'] = df['longitude'].astype('float32', errors='ignore')

# Drop the redundant 'location' column
df = df.drop(columns=['location'])

# Converting 'crash_date' and 'crash_time' columns into a single datetime column
df['crash_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['crash_date'] + ' ' 
                       + df['crash_time'], format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M', errors='coerce')

# Drop the original 'crash_date' and 'crash_time' columns
df = df.drop(columns=['crash_date', 'crash_time'])
```

Are missing in zip code and borough always co-occur?
```{python}
# Check if missing values in 'zip_code' and 'borough' always co-occur
# Count rows where both are missing
missing_cooccur = df[['zip_code', 'borough']].isnull().all(axis=1).sum()
# Count total missing in 'zip_code' and 'borough', respectively
total_missing_zip_code = df['zip_code'].isnull().sum()
total_missing_borough = df['borough'].isnull().sum()

# If missing in both columns always co-occur, the number of missing
# co-occurrences should be equal to the total missing in either column
missing_cooccur, total_missing_zip_code, total_missing_borough
```

Are there cases where zip_code and borough are missing
but the geo codes are not missing? If so, fill in `zip_code`
and `borough` using the geo codes by reverse geocoding.

First make sure `geopy` is installed.
``` shell
pip install geopy
```

Now we use model `Nominatim` in package `geopy` to reverse geocode.
```{python}
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
import time

# Initialize the geocoder; the `user_agent` is your identifier 
# when using the service. Be mindful not to crash the server
# by unlimited number of queries, especially invalid code.
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="jyGeopyTry")
```

We write a function to do the reverse geocoding given
lattitude and longitude.
```{python}
# Function to fill missing zip_code
def get_zip_code(latitude, longitude):
    try:
        location = geolocator.reverse((latitude, longitude), timeout=10)
        if location:
            address = location.raw['address']
            zip_code = address.get('postcode', None)
            return zip_code
        else:
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e} for coordinates {latitude}, {longitude}")
        return None
    finally:
        time.sleep(1)  # Delay to avoid overwhelming the service
```

Let's try it out:
```{python}
# Example usage
latitude = 40.730610
longitude = -73.935242
zip_code = get_zip_code(latitude, longitude)
```

The function `get_zip_code` can then be applied to
rows where zip code is missing but geocodes are not to
fill the missing zip code.

Once zip code is known, figuring out `burough` is simple
because valid zip codes from each borough are known.


## Cross-platform Data Format `Arrow`

The CSV format (and related formats like TSV - tab-separated values)
for data tables is ubiquitous, convenient, and can be read or written
by many different data analysis environments, including spreadsheets.
An advantage of the textual representation of the data in a CSV file 
is that the entire data table, or portions of it, can be previewed
in a text editor. However, the textual representation can be ambiguous
and inconsistent. The format of a particular column: Boolean, integer,
floating-point, text, factor, etc. must be inferred from text
representation, often at the expense of reading the entire file
before these inferences can be made. Experienced data scientists are aware
that a substantial part of an analysis or report generation is often
the "data cleaning" involved in preparing the data for analysis. This
can be an open-ended task --- it required numerous trial-and-error
iterations to create the list of different missing data
representations we use for the sample CSV file and even now we are
not sure we have them all.

To read and export data efficiently, leveraging the Apache `Arrow`
library can significantly improve performance and storage efficiency,
especially with large datasets. The IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
file format in the context of Apache Arrow is a key component for
efficiently sharing data between different processes, potentially
written in different programming languages. Arrow's IPC mechanism is
designed around two main file formats:

+ Stream Format: For sending an arbitrary length sequence of Arrow
  record batches (tables). The stream format is useful for real-time
  data exchange where the size of the data is not known upfront and can
  grow indefinitely.
+ File (or Feather) Format: Optimized for storage and memory-mapped
  access, allowing for fast random access to different sections of the
  data. This format is ideal for scenarios where the entire dataset is
  available upfront and can be stored in a file system for repeated
  reads and writes.


Apache Arrow provides a columnar
memory format for flat and hierarchical data, optimized for efficient
data analytics. It can be used in Python through the `pyarrow`
package. Here's how you can use Arrow to read, manipulate, and export
data, including a demonstration of storage savings.


First, ensure you have `pyarrow` installed on your computer (and
preferrably, in your current virtual environment):
``` shell
pip install pyarrow
```

Feather is a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use binary file format for
storing data frames, optimized for speed and efficiency, particularly
for IPC and data sharing between Python and R or Julia.

```{python}
#| eval: false
df.to_feather('data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather')

# Compare the file sizes of the feather format and the CSV format
import os

# File paths
csv_file = 'data/nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20240916.csv'
feather_file = 'data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather'

# Get file sizes in bytes
csv_size = os.path.getsize(csv_file)
feather_size = os.path.getsize(feather_file)

# Convert bytes to a more readable format (e.g., MB)
csv_size_mb = csv_size / (1024 * 1024)
feather_size_mb = feather_size / (1024 * 1024)

# Print the file sizes
print(f"CSV file size: {csv_size_mb:.2f} MB")
print(f"Feather file size: {feather_size_mb:.2f} MB")
```

Read the feather file back in:
```{python}
#| eval: false
dff = pd.read_feather("data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather")
dff.shape
```

## Using the Census Data

The [US Census](data.census.gov) provides a lot of useful data
that could be merged with the NYC crash data for further analytics.


First, ensure the DataFrame (df) is ready for merging with census
data. Specifically, check that the `zip_code` column is clean
and consistent.and consistent.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_feather("data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather")

valid_zip_df = df.dropna(subset=['zip_code']).copy()
valid_zip_df['zip_code'] = valid_zip_df['zip_code'].astype(int).astype(str).str.zfill(5)
unique_zips = valid_zip_df['zip_code'].unique()
```

We can use the `uszipcode` package to get basic demographic data
for each zip code. For more detailed or specific census data, 
using the `CensusData` package or direct API calls to the Census
Bureau's API.


The `uszipcode` package provides a range of information about
ZIP codes in the United States. When you query a ZIP code using
`uszipcode`, you can access various attributes related to
demographic data, housing, geographic location, and more. Here
are some of the key variables available at the ZIP code level:


**Demographic Information**

+ `population`: The total population.
+ `population_density`: The population per square kilometer.
+ `housing_units`: The total number of housing units.
+ `occupied_housing_units`: The number of occupied housing units.
+ `median_home_value`: The median value of homes.
+ `median_household_income`: The median household income.
+ `age_distribution`: A breakdown of the population by age.

**Geographic Information**


+ `zipcode`: The ZIP code.
+ `zipcode_type`: The type of ZIP code (e.g., Standard, PO Box).
+ `major_city`: The major city associated with the ZIP code.
+ `post_office_city`: The city name recognized by the U.S. Postal Service.
+ `common_city_list`: A list of common city names for the ZIP code.
+ `county`: The county in which the ZIP code is located.
+ `state`: The state in which the ZIP code is located.
+ `lat`: The latitude of the approximate center of the ZIP code.
+ `lng`: The longitude of the approximate center of the ZIP code.
+ `timezone`: The timezone of the ZIP code.

**Economic and Housing Data**

+ `land_area_in_sqmi`: The land area in square miles.
+ `water_area_in_sqmi`: The water area in square miles.
+ `occupancy_rate`: The rate of occupancy for housing units.
+ `median_age`: The median age of the population.


Install the `uszipcode` package into the current virtual environment,
if it has not been installd yet.
```bash
pip install uszipcode


``
We will first clean the `zip_code` column to ensure it only
contains valid ZIP codes. Then, we will use a vectorized
approach to fetch the required data for each unique zip code
and merge this information back into the original `DataFrame`.
`{python}
# Remove rows where 'zip_code' is missing or not a valid ZIP code format
valid_zip_df = df.dropna(subset=['zip_code']).copy()
valid_zip_df['zip_code'] = valid_zip_df['zip_code'].astype(str).str.zfill(5)

```


Since `uszipcode` doesn't valid_zip_dfrently support vectorized operations
for multiple ZIP code queries, we'll optimize the process by
querying each unique ZIP code once, then merging the results
with the original `DataFrame`. This approach minimizes redundant
queries for ZIP codes that appear multiple

 times.

```{python}
from uszipcode import SearchEngine

# Initialize the SearchEngine
search = SearchEngine()

# Fetch median home value and median household income for each unique ZIP code
zip_data = []
for zip_code in unique_zips:
    result = search.by_zipcode(zip_code)
    if result:  # Check if the result is not None
        zip_data.append({
            "zip_code": zip_code,
            "median_home_value": result.median_home_value,
            "median_household_income": result.median_household_income
        })
    else:  # Handle the case where the result is None
        zip_data.append({
            "zip_code": zip_code,
            "median_home_value": None,
            "median_household_income": None
        })

# Convert to DataFrame
zip_info_df = pd.DataFrame(zip_data)

# Merge this info back into the original DataFrame based on 'zip_code'
merged_df = pd.merge(valid_zip_df, zip_info_df, how="left", on="zip_code")
merged_df.to_feather('data/nyccrashes_merged.feather')

merged_df.head()
```
