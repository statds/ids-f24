# Communication in Data Science

This chapter was written by Sara Clokey.

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Sara, and I am a junior double majoring in Applied Data 
Analysis and Communication. The topic of my presentation today, 
Communication in Data Science, combines my academic and professional
interests while underscoring the importance of 'soft skills' like public
speaking, for example, within STEM fields like data science.

## Importance & Application of Communication
Data science as a career path has exploded within the last decade. Some 
fields that offer data science positions include:

+ Finance
+ Healthcare
+ Media production
+ Sports
+ Banking
+ Insurance
+ E-Commerce
+ Energy
+ Manufacturing
+ Transportation
+ Construction

Because data science is applicable in so many industries, it is essential that
data scientists have the skills and experience to communicate their work with
others who do not have the same technical education. As analyzed by 
@zinovy2018skills, job listings within the field of data science often include
qualifications like "strong interpersonal skills" and "demonstrated presentation
and communication ability," highlighting the pervasive need for this skill set.

Within these industries, collaboration and teamwork are often at the forefront.
Inexperience with data should not prevent your colleagues from being able to
contribute to shared projects, and strong communication skills can mitigate 
this challenge!

## General Communication Skills

### Verbal Communication Skills

Verbal Communication: "The use of sounds and language to relay a message"
(@fer2018verbal)

Verbal Communication Tips:

+ Make a good first impression
+ Use appropriate language (jargon, metaphors)
+ Prioritize brevity
+ Practice beforehand
+ Allow room for questions

### Non-Verbal Communication Skills

Non-Verbal Communication: "Information, emotion, a movement that is expressed
without words and without the help of language" (@grillo2022nonverbal)

Non-Verbal Communication Tips:

+ Utilize vocal variety (pitch, rate, volume)
+ Avoid distracting hand and body movements
+ Make eye contact
+ Pay attention to proxemics

### Visual Communication Skills

Visual Communication: "Any communication that employs one’s sense of 
sight to deliver a message without the usage of any verbal cues" 
(@fayaz2022visual)

Visual Communication Tips:

+ Prioritize clarity
+ Use proper labeling and scaling
+ Create visual contrast (colors, shapes, fonts)
+ Choose the most appropriate visual representation

### Written Communication Skills

Written Communication: "Any form of
communication which is written and documented from
the sender to the receiver" (@prabavathi2018written)

Written Communication Tips:

+ Clearly state your goal with a thesis statement
+ Maintain professionalism (contractions, slang)
+ Proofread and utilize peer editing
+ Follow a specific structure
+ Balance concision with analysis

## Communication in Data Science

Often, data scientists must communicate "technical
conclusions to non-technical members" (@pragmatic2024communication); this may be colleagues in other
departments, like marketing, or supervisors at the managerial level. Here are some
tips for effectively communicating project results specifically in the field of
data science.

### Identify your Audience
Who are you sharing information with? Is it a room of data scientists like this
one? Is it full of students who want to learn about data science? Is it a group
of executives looking to make a funding decision?

+ Consider the context and prior knowledge (technical jargon)
+ Consider the motivation for listening

### Utilize Data Visualization
One of the most effective methods of communicating results in data science,
especially to those without technical coding knowledge, is data visualization
techniques. Python uses the package 'matplotlib' to produce these visualizations, 
including:

+ line plots
+ bar plots
+ box plots
+ histograms
+ heat maps
+ pie charts

These visualizations allow complex statistical projects to be simplified 
into a single graphic, focusing on project results and implications
rather than methodology. Ensure that data visualization techniques are free of
technical jargon and clearly label all visual aspects.

What is wrong with the bar plot on the left? How is it fixed in the plot
on the right?

### Focus on  Data Communication Skills
The following skill sets highlight technical data communication that will
be more common in projects with other data scientists to communicate
about your data.

+ Coding communication: Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, SQL, etc.
+ Analysis communication: creating a storyline, descriptive versus 
diagnostic versus predictive analytics, problem identification
+ Data management: collection, cleaning/transformation, storage
+ Data visualization

### Give Space for Questions and Feedback
Within professional spaces, data scientists should provide time 
for their clients, supervisors, and colleagues to ask questions about their
work and subsequent findings. 

+ Pause for questions throughout the presentation
+ Offer contact information for continued collaboration
+ Provide a structure for anonymous feedback
+ Schedule follow-ups if necessary

Teamwork is often at the heart of data science projects within industries, and 
open communication makes this teamwork run much more smoothly.

## Further Learning
While pursuing degrees in the data science field, consider taking Communication
courses at UConn that can bolster your understanding and skill set. Some applicable
communication courses include:

+ COMM 2100: Professional Communication
+ COMM 3110: Organizational Communication
+ COMM 3430: Science Communication
+ COMM 5655: Human-Computer Interaction
+ COMM 5900: Professional Communication

Effective communication also requires practice. Here are some ways to practice 
these skills while earning your degree:

+ Fully participate in group projects
+ Seek presentation opportunities (class, conferences, etc.)
+ Explain data science coursework to peers outside of your program
+ Explore internship opportunities that involve collaboration with
other departments
