Removing a file was easy, but recovering it was hard. I had to try several methods to get it done. It was a hard task. However, I could finnaly pull it off. Git is fun when you know it pretty well. I am having a hard time learning the commands. I hope I will get the vibe soon and I also will enjoy working with git.

I think I will get better at git. 



git operations I have used so far:
    - cd to change directory
    - pwd to view present working directory
    - git status to check the status of my git
    - git log to see the commits that has been done so far.
    - git different to check the difference between current and previous commit.
    - git commit -m to commit the file.
    - git checkout <commit_hash> -- file.ex to recover the deleted file.
    - rm to remove a file
    - git reset --hard <commit_hash> for resetting to a previous commit
