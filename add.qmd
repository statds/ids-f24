Deleted a file easy, but recovering it was hard. I had to try several methods to get it done. It was a hard task. However, I could finnaly pull it off. Git is fun when you know it pretty well. I am having a hard time learning the commands. I hope I will get the vibe soon and I also will enjoy working with git.

I think I will be good at git.
