    "text": "Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this insightful quote from VanderPlas (2016):\n\nWhen a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast resources available to solve complex problems in data science. Examples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware); search and find solutions to encountered problems.",

This framework helps to underscore the interdisciplinary nature of data science, where expertise in one area is often complemented by foundational knowledge in the others.\nA compelling definition was offered by Prof. Bin Yu in her 2014 Presidential Address to the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. She defines \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\mbox{Data Science} =\n\\mbox{S}\\mbox{D}\\mbox{C}^3,\n\\end{equation*}\\] where\nComputing underscores the need for proficiency in programming and algorithmic thinking, collaboration/teamwork reflects the inherently collaborative nature of data science projects, often requiring teams with diverse skill sets, and communication to outsiders emphasizes the importance of translating complex data insights into understandable and actionable information for non-experts.\nThis definition neatly captures the essence of data science, emphasizing a balance between technical skills, teamwork, and the ability to communicate effectively.",

    "text": "3.2 Compiling the Classnotes\nThe sources of the classnotes are at https://github.com/statds/ids-f24. This is also the source tree that you will contributed to this semester. I expect that you clone the repository to your own computer, update it frequently, and compile the latest version on your computer (reproducibility).\nTo compile the classnotes, you need the following tools: Git, Quarto, and Python.\n\n3.2.1 Set up your Python Virtual Environment\nI suggest that a Python virtual environment for the classnotes be set up in the current directory for reproducibility. A Python virtual environment is simply a directory with a particular file structure, which contains a specific Python interpreter and software libraries and binaries needed to support a project. It allows us to isolate our Python development projects from our system installed Python and other Python environments.\nTo create a Python virtual environment for our classnotes:\npython3 -m venv .ids-f24-venv\nHere .ids-f24-venv is the name of the virtual environment to be created. Choose an informative name. This only needs to be set up once.\nTo activate this virtual environment:\n. .ids-f24-venv/bin/activate\nAfter activating the virtual environment, you will see (.ids-f24-venv) at the beginning of your shell prompt. Then, the Python interpreter and packages needed will be the local versions in this virtual environment without interfering your system-wide installation or other virtual environments.\nTo install the Python packages that are needed to compile the classnotes, we have a requirements.txt file that specifies the packages and their versions. They can be installed easily with:\npip install -r requirements.txt\nIf you are interested in learning how to create the requirements.txt file, just put your question into a Google search.\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate in your command line.

    "text": "4.1.1 Operating System\nYour computer has an operating system (OS), which is responsible for managing the software packages on your computer. Each operating system has its own package management system. For example:\n\nLinux: Linux distributions have a variety of package managers depending on the distribution. For instance, Ubuntu uses APT (Advanced Package Tool), Fedora uses DNF (Dandified Yum), and Arch Linux uses Pacman. These package managers are integral to the Linux experience, allowing users to install, update, and manage software packages easily from repositories.\nmacOS: macOS uses Homebrew as its primary package manager. Homebrew simplifies the installation of software and tools that aren’t included in the standard macOS installation, using simple commands in the terminal.\nWindows: Windows users often rely on the Microsoft Store for apps and software. For more developer-focused package management, tools like Chocolatey and Windows Package Manager (Winget) are used. Additionally, recent versions of Windows have introduced the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows Windows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, unifying Windows and Linux applications and tools. This is particularly useful for developers and data scientists who need to run Linux-specific software or scripts. It saves a lot of trouble Windows users used to have before its time.\n\nUnderstanding the package management system of your operating system is crucial for effectively managing and installing software, especially for data science tools and applications.\n\n\n4.1.2 File System\nA file system is a fundamental aspect of a computer’s operating system, responsible for managing how data is stored and retrieved on a storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB flash drive. Essentially, it provides a way for the OS and users to organize and keep track of files. Different operating systems typically use different file systems. For instance, NTFS and FAT32 are common in Windows, APFS and HFS+ in macOS, and Ext4 in many Linux distributions. Each file system has its own set of rules for controlling the allocation of space on the drive and the naming, storage, and access of files, which impacts performance, security, and compatibility. Understanding file systems is crucial for tasks such as data recovery, disk partitioning, and managing file permissions, making it an important concept for anyone working with computers, especially in data science and IT fields.\nNavigating through folders in the command line, especially in Unix-like environments such as Linux or macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), is an essential skill for effective file management. The command cd (change directory) is central to this process. To move into a specific directory, you use cd followed by the directory name, like cd Documents. To go up one level in the directory hierarchy, you use cd ... To return to the home directory, simply typing cd or cd ~ will suffice. The ls command lists all files and folders in the current directory, providing a clear view of your options for navigation. Mastering these commands, along with others like pwd (print working directory), which displays your current directory, equips you with the basics of moving around the file system in the command line, an indispensable skill for a wide range of computing tasks in Unix-like systems.\nYou have programmed in Python. Regardless of your skill level, let us do some refreshing.",

    "text": "4.6 Variables versus Objects\nIn Python, variables and the objects they point to actually live in two different places in the computer memory. Think of variables as pointers to the objects they’re associated with, rather than being those objects. This matters when multiple variables point to the same object.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]  # create a list; x points to the list\ny = x          # y also points to the same list in the memory\ny.append(4)    # append to y\nx              # x changed!\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n4969455424\n4969455424\n\n\nNonetheless, some data types in Python are “immutable”, meaning that their values cannot be changed in place. One such example is strings.\n\nx = \"abc\"\ny = x\ny = \"xyz\"\nx\n\n'abc'\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n4443959560\n4587305744\n\n\nQuestion: What’s mutable and what’s immutable?\nAnything that is a collection of other objects is mutable, except tuples.\nNot all manipulations of mutable objects change the object rather than create a new object. Sometimes when you do something to a mutable object, you get back a new object. Manipulations that change an existing object, rather than create a new one, are referred to as “in-place mutations” or just “mutations.” So:\n\nAll manipulations of immutable types create new objects.\nSome manipulations of mutable types create new objects.\n\nDifferent variables may all be pointing at the same object is preserved through function calls (a behavior known as “pass by object-reference”). So if you pass a list to a function, and that function manipulates that list using an in-place mutation, that change will affect any variable that was pointing to that same object outside the function.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = x\n\ndef append_42(input_list):\n    input_list.append(42)\n    return input_list\n\nappend_42(x)\n\n[1, 2, 3, 42]\n\n\nNote that both x and y have been appended by \\(42\\).",

Among them, 1 is for sign, 11 is for exponent, and 52 are fraction significand, See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format. The bottom line is that, of course, not every real number is exactly representable.\n\n0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n0.3 - 0.2 == 0.1\n\nFalse\n\n\nWhat is really going on?\n\nimport decimal\ndecimal.Decimal(0.1)\n\nDecimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')\n\n\nBecause the mantissa bits are limited, it can not represent a floating point that’s both very big and very precise.

    "text": "4.8 Virtual Environment\nVirtual environments in Python are essential tools for managing dependencies and ensuring consistency across projects. They allow you to create isolated environments for each project, with its own set of installed packages, separate from the global Python installation. This isolation prevents conflicts between project dependencies and versions, making your projects more reliable and easier to manage. It’s particularly useful when working on multiple projects with differing requirements, or when collaborating with others who may have different setups.\nTo set up a virtual environment, you first need to ensure that Python is installed on your system. Most modern Python installations come with the venv module, which is used to create virtual environments. Here’s how to set one up:\n\nOpen your command line interface.\nNavigate to your project directory.\nRun python3 -m venv myenv, where myenv is the name of the virtual environment to be created. Choose an informative name.\n\nThis command creates a new directory named myenv (or your chosen name) in your project directory, containing the virtual environment.\nTo start using this environment, you need to activate it. The activation command varies depending on your operating system:\n\nOn Windows, run myenv\\Scripts\\activate.\nOn Linux or MacOS, use source myenv/bin/activate or . myenv/bin/activate.\n\nOnce activated, your command line will typically show the name of the virtual environment, and you can then install and use packages within this isolated environment without affecting your global Python setup.\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate in your command line. This will return you to your system’s global Python environment.\nAs an example, let’s install a package, like numpy, in this newly created virtual environment:\n\nEnsure your virtual environment is activated.\nRun pip install numpy.\n\nThis command installs the requests library in your virtual environment. You can verify the installation by running pip list, which should show requests along with its version.",

If so, geocode the addresses.\n(Optional) Are the missing patterns of ON STREET NAME and LATITUDE the same? Summarize the missing patterns by a cross table. If ON STREET NAME and CROSS STREET NAME are available, use geocoding by intersection to fill the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE.\nAre ZIP CODE and BOROUGH always missing together? If LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are available, use reverse geocoding to fill the ZIP CODE and BOROUGH.\nPrint the whole frequency table of CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1. Convert lower cases to uppercases and check the frequencies again.\nProvided an opportunity to meet the data provider, what suggestions do you have to make the data better based on your data exploration experience?\n\nExcept the first problem, use the cleaned data set with missing geocode imputed (data/nyc_crashes_202301_cleaned.csv).\n\nConstruct a contigency table for missing in geocode (latitude and longitude) by borough. Is the missing pattern the same across borough? Formulate a hypothesis and test it.\nConstruct a hour variable with integer values from 0 to 23. Plot the histogram of the number of crashes by hour. Plot it by borough.\nOverlay the locations of the crashes on a map of NYC. The map could be a static map or Google map.\nCreate a new variable injury which is one if the number of persons injured is 1 or more; and zero otherwise. Construct a cross table for injury versus borough. Test the null hypothesis that the two variables are not associated.\nMerge the crash data with the zip code database.\nFit a logistic model with injury as the outcome variable and covariates that are available in the data or can be engineered from the data. For example, zip code level covariates can be obtained by merging with the zip code database.\n\nUsing the cleaned NYC crash data, perform classification of injury with support vector machine and compare the results with the benchmark from regularized logistic regression. Use the last week’s data as testing data.\n\nExplain the parameters you used in your fitting for each method.\nExplain the confusion matrix result from each fit.\nCompare the performance of the two approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.\n\nThe NYC Open Data of 311 Service Requests contains all requests from 2010 to present. We consider a subset of it with request time between 00:00:00 01/15/2023 and 24:00:00 01/21/2023. The subset is available in CSV format as data/nyc311_011523-012123_by022023.csv. Read the data dictionary to understand the meaning of the variables,\n\nClean the data: fill missing fields as much as possible; check for obvious data entry errors (e.g., can Closed Date be earlier than Created Date?); summarize your suggestions to the data curator in several bullet points.\nRemove requests that are not made to NYPD and create a new variable duration, which represents the time period from the Created Date to Closed Date. Note that duration may be censored for some requests. Visualize the distribution of uncensored duration by weekdays/weekend and by borough, and test whether the distributions are the same across weekdays/weekends of their creation and across boroughs.\nDefine a binary variable over3h which is 1 if duration is greater than 3 hours. Note that it can be obtained even for censored duration. Build a model to predict over3h. If your model has tuning parameters, justify their choices. Apply this model to the 311 requests of NYPD in the week of 01/22/2023. Assess the performance of your model.\nNow you know the data quite well. Come up with a research question of interest that can be answered by the data, which could be analytics or visualizations. Perform the needed analyses and answer your question.\n\nNYC Rodents Rats in NYC are widespread, as they are in many densely populated areas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats_in_New_York_City). As of October 2023, NYC dropped from the 2nd to the 3rd places in the annual “rattiest city” list released by a pest control company. In the 311 Service Request Data, there is one complain type Rodent. Extract all the requests with complain type Rodent, created between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023. Save them into a csv file named rodent_2022-2023.csv.\n\nAre there any complains that are not closed yet?\nAre there any complains with a closed data before the created date?\nHow many agencies were this complain type reported to?\nSummarize the missingess for each variable.\nSummarize a frequency table for the descriptor variable, and summarize a cross table by year.\nWhich types of ‘DESCRIPTOR’ do you think should be included if our interest is rodent sighting?\nTake a subset of the data with the descriptors you chose and summarize the response time by borough.\n\nNYC rodent sightings data cleaning The data appears to need some cleaning before any further analysis. Some missing values could be filled based on other columns.\n\nChecking all 47 column names suggests that some columns might be redundant. Identify them and demonstrate the redundancy.\nAre zip code and borough always missing together? If geocodes are available, use reverse geocoding to fill the zip code.\nExport the cleaned data in both csv and feather format. Comment on the file sizes.\n\nSQL Practice on NYC rodent sightings The NYC rodent sightings data that we prepared could be stored more efficiently using a database. Let us start from the csv file you exported from the last problem.\n\nCreate a table called rodent from the csv file.\nThe agency and agency_name columns are redundant in the table. Create a table called agency, which contains only these two columns, one agency a row.\nDrop the agency_name name from the rodent table. Justify why we do not need it here.\nComment on the sizes of the table (or exported csv file) of rodent before and after dropping the agency_name column.\nCome up with a scheme for the two tables that allows even more efficient storage of the agency column in the rodent table. _Hint: use an integer to code the agencies.\n\nLogistic Modeling The response time to 311 service requests is a measure of civic service quality. Let us model the response time to 311 requests with complain type Rodent.\n\nCompute the response time in hours. Note that some response will be missing because of unavailable closed date.\nCompute a binary variable over3d, which is one if the response time is greater than 3 days, and zero otherwise. Note that this variable should have no missing values.\nUse the package uszipcode to obtain the zip code level covariates such as median house income and median home value. Merge these variables to the rodent data.\nSplit the data at random into training (80%) and testing (20%). Build a logistic model to predict over3d on the training data, and validate the performance on the testing data.\nBuild a lasso logistic model to predict over3d, and justify your choice of the tuning parameter. Validate on the testing data.\n\nMidterm Project: Rodents in NYC Rodents in NYC are widespread, as they are in many densely populated areas. As of October 2023, NYC dropped from the 2nd to the 3rd places in the annual “rattiest city” list released by a pest control company. Rat sightings in NYC was analyzed by Dr. Michael Walsh in a 2014 PeerJ article. We investigate this problem from a different angle with the NYC Rodent Inspection data, provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Download the 2022-2023 data by filtering the INSPECTION_DATE to between 11:59:59 pm of 12/31/2021 and 12:00:00 am of 01/01/2024 and INSPECTION_TYPE is either Initial or Compliance (which should be about 108 MB). Read the meta data information to understand the data.\n\nData cleaning.\n\nThere are two zipcode columns: ZIP_CODE and Zipcodes. Which one represent the zipcode of the inspection site? Comment on the data dictionary.\nSummarize the missing information. Are their missing values that can be filled using other columns? Fill them if yes.\nAre their redundant information in the data? Try storing the data using arrow and comment on the efficiency gain.\nAre there invalid zipcode or borough? Justify and clean them up if yes.\n\nData exploration.\n\nCreate binary variable passing indicating passing or not for the inspection result. Does passing depend on whether the inspection is initial or compliance? State your hypothesis and summarize your test result.\nAre the passing pattern different across different boroughs for initial inspections? How about compliance inspections? State your hypothesis and summarize your test results.\nIf we suspect that the passing rate may depends on the time of a day of the inspection, we may compare the passting rates for inspections done in the mornings and inspections one in the afternoons. Visualize the comparison by borough and inspection type.\nPerform a formal hypothesis test to confirm the observations from your visualization.\n\nData analytics.\n\nAggregate the inspections by zip code to create a dataset with five columns. The first three columns are zipcode; n_initial, the count of the initial inspections in that zipcode; and n_initpass, the number of initial inspections with a passing result in that zipcode. The other two variables are n_compliance and n_comppass, the counterpart for compliance inspections.\nAdd a variable to your dataset, n_sighting, which represent the number of rodent sightings from the 311 service request data in the same 2022-2023 period.\nMerge your dataset with the simple zipcode table in package uszipcode by zipcode to obtain demographic and socioeconomic variables at the zipcode level.\nBuild a binomial regression for the passing rate of initial inspections at the zipcode level. Assess the goodness-of-fit of your model. Summarize your results to a New Yorker who is not data science savvy.\n\nNow you know the data quite well. Come up with a research question of interest that can be answered by the data, which could be analytics or visualizations. Perform the needed analyses and answer your question.",
