This cooperative approach to education was facilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages collaborative coding and content development. To view these contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please visit our Spring 2024 repository at https://github.com/statds/ids-f24.\nStudents contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests to our dedicated GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the course material but also provided students with practical experience in collaborative software development and version control.\nFor those interested in exploring the lecture notes from the previous years, the Spring 2024, Spring 2023 and Spring 2022 are both publicly accessible. These archives offer valuable insights into the evolution of the course content and the different perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.",

To emphasize this, consider this insightful quote from VanderPlas (2016):\n\nWhen a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast resources available to solve complex problems in data science.",

    "text": "1.1 What Is Data Science?\nData science is a multifaceted field, often conceptualized as resting on three fundamental pillars: mathematics/statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge. This framework helps to underscore the interdisciplinary nature of data science, where expertise in one area is often complemented by foundational knowledge in the others.\nA compelling definition was offered by Prof. Bin Yu in her 2014 Presidential Address to the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. She defines \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\mbox{Data Science} =\n\\mbox{S}\\mbox{D}\\mbox{C}^3,\n\\end{equation*}\\] where\nComputing underscores the need for proficiency in programming and algorithmic thinking, collaboration/teamwork reflects the inherently collaborative nature of data science projects, often requiring teams with diverse skill sets, and communication to outsiders emphasizes the importance of translating complex data insights into understandable and actionable information for non-experts.\nThis definition neatly captures the essence of data science, emphasizing a balance between technical skills, teamwork, and the ability to communicate effectively.",
