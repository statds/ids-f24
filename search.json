    "text": "Sources at GitHub\nThese lecture notes for STAT 3255/5255 in Fall 2024 represent a collaborative effort between Professor Jun Yan and the students enrolled in the course. This cooperative approach to education was facilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages collaborative coding and content development. To view these contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please visit our Spring 2024 repository at https://github.com/statds/ids-f24.\nStudents contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests to our dedicated GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the course material but also provided students with practical experience in collaborative software development and version control.\nFor those interested in exploring the lecture notes from the previous years, the Spring 2024, Spring 2023 and Spring 2022 are both publicly accessible. These archives offer valuable insights into the evolution of the course content and the different perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.",

    "text": "Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this insightful quote from VanderPlas (2016):\n\nWhen a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast resources available to solve complex problems in data science.",

Remember that these class notes are publicly available online with your names attached. Here are some resources on []how to avoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). In particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use our own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the code chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.\n\n\nHomework Requirements\n\nUse the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See Section ?sec-git.\n\nKeep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).\nNever “Upload” your files; use the git command lines.\nMake commit message informative (think about the readers).\n\nUse quarto source only. See ?sec-quarto.\nFor the convenience of grading, add your html output to a release in your repo.",
