Since R has a richer collections of statistical functions, we can call 
R function from Python with `rpy2`. See, for example, a [blog on this
subject](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/05/25/calling-r-from-python-with-rpy2/).


For example, `fisher_exact` can only handle 2x2 contingency tables. For
contingency tables larger than 2x2, we can call `fisher.text()` from R through
`rpy2`. 
See [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25368284/fishers-exact-test-for-bigger-than-2-by-2-contingency-table).
Note that the `.` in function names and arguments are replaced with `_`.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri.activate()

stats = importr('stats')

w0630 = pd.read_feather("data/nyccrashes_cleaned.feather")
w0630["injury"] = np.where(w0630["number_of_persons_injured"] > 0, 1, 0)
m = pd.crosstab(w0630["injury"], w0630["borough"])
print(m)

res = stats.fisher_test(m.to_numpy(), simulate_p_value = True)
print(res)
```



## Statistical Modeling

Statistical modeling is a cornerstone of data science, offering tools to
understand complex relationships within data and to make predictions. Python,
with its rich ecosystem for data analysis, features the `statsmodels` package—
a comprehensive library designed for statistical modeling, tests, and data
exploration. `statsmodels` stands out for its focus on classical statistical
models and compatibility with the Python scientific stack (`numpy`, `scipy`,
`pandas`).

### Installation of `statsmodels`

To start with statistical modeling, ensure `statsmodels` is installed:

Using pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

### Linear Model

Let's simulate some data for illustrations.

```{python}
import numpy as np

nobs = 200
ncov = 5
np.random.seed(123)
x = np.random.random((nobs, ncov)) # Uniform over [0, 1)
beta = np.repeat(1, ncov)
y = 2 + np.dot(x, beta) + np.random.normal(size = nobs)
```

Check the shape of `y`:
```{python}
y.shape
```

Check the shape of `x`:
```{python}
x.shape
```

That is, the true linear regression model is
\[
y = 2 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + \epsilon.
\]

A regression model for the observed data can be fitted as

```{python}
import statsmodels.api as sma
xmat = sma.add_constant(x)
mymod = sma.OLS(y, xmat)
myfit = mymod.fit()
myfit.summary()
```

Questions to review:

+ How are the regression coefficients interpreted? Intercept?
+ Why does it make sense to center the covariates?


Now we form a data frame with the variables

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = np.concatenate((y.reshape((nobs, 1)), x), axis = 1)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = df,
                  columns = ["y"] + ["x" + str(i) for i in range(1,
                  ncov + 1)])
df.info()
```

Let's use a formula to specify the regression model as in R, and fit
a robust linear model (`rlm`) instead of OLS. Note that the model specification
and the function interface is similar to R.

```{python}
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
mymod = smf.rlm(formula = "y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5", data = df)
myfit = mymod.fit()
myfit.summary()
```

For model diagnostics, one can check residual plots.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

myOlsFit = smf.ols(formula = "y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5", data = df).fit()
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (6, 6))
## residual versus x1; can do the same for other covariates
fig = sma.graphics.plot_regress_exog(myOlsFit, 'x1', fig=fig)
```

tests](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/stats.html#residual-diagnostics-and-specification-tests).


### Generalized Linear Regression

A linear regression model cannot be applied to presence/absence or
count data.  Generalized Linear Models (GLM) extend the classical
linear regression to accommodate such response variables, that follow
distributions other than the normal distribution. GLMs consist of
three main components:


+ **Random Component**: This specifies the distribution of the 
response variable $Y$. It is assumed to be from the exponential family of 
distributions, such as Binomial for binary data and Poisson for count data.
+ **Systematic Component**: This consists of the linear predictor, 
a linear combination of unknown parameters and explanatory variables. It 
is denoted as $\eta = X\beta$, where $X$ represents the explanatory 
variables, and $\beta$ represents the coefficients.
+ **Link Function**: The link function, $g$, provides the 
relationship between the linear predictor and the mean of the distribution 
function. For a GLM, the mean of $Y$ is related to the linear predictor 
through the link function as $\mu = g^{-1}(\eta)$.


GLMs adapt to various data types through the
selection of appropriate link functions and probability distributions. Here,
we outline four special cases of GLM: normal regression, logistic regression,
Poisson regression, and gamma regression.


+ Normal Regression (Linear Regression).
In normal regression, the response variable has a normal distribution. The
identity link function ($g(\mu) = \mu$) is typically used, making this case
equivalent to classical linear regression.
    - **Use Case**: Modeling continuous data where residuals are normally distributed.
    - **Link Function**: Identity ($g(\mu) = \mu$)
    - **Distribution**: Normal
+ Logistic Regression.
Logistic regression is used for binary response variables. It employs the
logit link function to model the probability that an observation falls into
one of two categories.
    - **Use Case**: Binary outcomes (e.g., success/failure).
    - **Link Function**: Logit ($g(\mu) = \log\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}$)
    - **Distribution**: Binomial
+ Poisson Regression.
Poisson regression models count data using the Poisson distribution. It's
ideal for modeling the rate at which events occur.
    - **Use Case**: Count data, such as the number of occurrences of an event.
    - **Link Function**: Log ($g(\mu) = \log(\mu)$)
    - **Distribution**: Poisson
+ Gamma Regression.
Gamma regression is suited for modeling positive continuous variables, 
especially when data are skewed and variance increases with the mean.
    - **Use Case**: Positive continuous outcomes with non-constant variance.
    - **Link Function**: Inverse ($g(\mu) = \frac{1}{\mu}$)
    - **Distribution**: Gamma

Each GLM variant addresses specific types of data and research questions,
enabling precise modeling and inference based on the underlying data
distribution.


A logistic regression can be fit with `statsmodels.api.glm`.

Let's generate some binary data first by dichotomizing existing variables.

```{python}
import statsmodels.genmod as smg
eta = x.dot([2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) - 5
p = smg.families.links.Logit().inverse(eta)
df["yb"] = np.random.binomial(1, p, p.size)
```

Fit a logistic regression for `y1b`.

```{python}
mylogistic = smf.glm(formula = 'yb ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5', data = df,
                     family = smg.families.Binomial())
mylfit = mylogistic.fit()
mylfit.summary()
```



If we treat `y1b` as count data, a Poisson regression can be fitted.

```{python}
myPois = smf.glm(formula = 'yb ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5', data = df,
                 family = smg.families.Poisson())
mypfit = myPois.fit()
mypfit.summary()
```
